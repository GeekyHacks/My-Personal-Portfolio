# Notes:
- use em for more responsive page 1em =16px
- @media (min-width for mobile first designs
- avoid using min-width & max-width at the same styling
- its better to use media query inside tags or classes rather than repeating all tags inside @media
- if you gonna use media than put all changes inside it and make sure its all coded at the end of css
  to avoid those rules being canceled out
